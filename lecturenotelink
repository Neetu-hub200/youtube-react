1. React Fiber
https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture 
Interview imp 
Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; 
the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

2. What is reconciliation?
. reconciliation?
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
. update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`.
Eventually results in a re-render.
**** Important line ****
Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."
Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

3. What is a fiber?
Specifically, we need to be able to: 
. pause work and come back to it later.
. assign priority to different types of work.
. reuse previously completed work.
. abort work if it's no longer needed. 


4. Interview question for counter One
   setCounter(counter + 1);
    setCounter(counter + 1);
    setCounter(counter + 1);
    setCounter(counter + 1);
this will give the update only one time as if vaue is 10 resukt will be 11 on click bcz it will work in a batch, get process like a bunch and update the value of counter only once.

    setCounter((prevCounter)=> prevCounter + 1);
    setCounter((prevCounter)=> prevCounter + 1);
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
this will give the output of the last number after the total number of update as if value is 15 then output will be 19 bcz it will take the value of the previous counter not as in a bunch but in a single LOC.

********************HOOKS****************************

5. useCallback
useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)

6. useEffect
useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)

7. useRef
useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value.
const ref = useRef(initialValue)

8. useState
useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

9. useId
useId is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.
const id = useId()
!!Do not call useId to generate keys in a list. Keys should be generated from your data.

10. Interview question
*****Link: we use in place of  'a' tag, whenerver we use 'a' tag whole page get refresh and in react we dont haave refresh concept, we should not react 'a' tag.
*****NavLink: Wraps <Link> with additional props for styling active and pending states.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; 
the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

2. What is reconciliation?
. reconciliation?
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
. update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`.
Eventually results in a re-render.
**** Important line ****
Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."
Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

3. What is a fiber?
Specifically, we need to be able to: 
. pause work and come back to it later.
. assign priority to different types of work.
. reuse previously completed work.
. abort work if it's no longer needed.
